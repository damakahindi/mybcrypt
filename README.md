# mybcrypt
A node project that lets you encrypt words via the console.

I had a unique issue to bcrypt some sensitive data that I had. I couldn't use the online tools so I create a node app for this.

## Installing
1. You can clone the repo.
2. Remember to npm install.
3. Run `node index.js help`
4. Encrypt using bcrypt
5. Confirm a encrypted string matches a certain word.
